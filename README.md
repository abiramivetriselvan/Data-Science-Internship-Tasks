**LEVEL 1**
**Task1: Data Exploration and Preprocessing**

1.Explore the dataset and identify the number
of rows and columns.

2.Check for missing values in each column and
handle them accordingly.

3.Perform data type conversion if necessary.
Analyze the distribution of the target variable
("Aggregate rating") and identify any class
imbalances.

**Task2: Descriptive Analysis**

1.Calculate basic statistical measures (mean,
median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical
columns.

2.Explore the distribution of categorical
variables like "Country Code","City" and "Cuisines".

3.Identify the top cuisines and cities with the
highest number of restaurants.

**Task3: Geospatial Analysis**

1.Visualize the locations of restaurants on a
map using latitude and longitude
information.

2.Analyze the distribution of restaurants
across different cities or countries.
Determine if there is any correlation
between the restaurant's location and its
rating.

**LEVEL 3**

**Task1: Predictive Modeling**

1.Build a regression model to predict the
aggregate rating of a restaurant based on
available features.
Split the dataset into training and testing sets
and evaluate the model's performance using
appropriate metrics.

2.Experiment with different algorithms (e.g.,
linear regression, decision trees, random
forest) and compare their performance.

**Task2: Customer Preference Analysis**

1.Analyze the relationship between the type of
cuisine and the restaurant's rating.

2.Identify the most popular cuisines among
customers based on the number of votes.

3.Determine if there are any specific cuisines
that tend to receive higher ratings.

**Task3: Data Visualization**

1.Create visualizations to represent the distribution
of ratings using different charts (histogram, bar
plot, etc.).

2.Compare the average ratings of different cuisines
or cities using appropriate visualizations.

3.Visualize the relationship between various
features and the target variable to gain insights.
